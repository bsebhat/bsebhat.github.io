![Homer's cybersecurity VM Lab](homer-lab.png)
## Labs?
Labs are just things I work on to help me learn new subjects. I have a hard time learning technical subjects without some hands on experience.

## Why?
I'm trying to learn more about cybersecurity, like how to analyze the security risks of computer networks and web applications. So I use virtual machines (VMs) to create a crude and simplistic simulation of real world scenarios, like how a small organization with desktops and servers and switch devices can create a network.
