## What Do I Mean By "Labs"?
Labs are just things I work on to help me learn new subjects. I have a hard time learning technical subjects without some hands on experience. They use virtual machines, operating systems, and software to create a small scale, simplified simulation of common cybersecurity and IT concepts. And I try to use them to understand security concepts.

Like the ["Principle of least privilege"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege). It's a principle I recently learned about taking an online cybersecurity course, but it helps if I'm using a firewall and can see how allowed traffic can be controlled. Or with Active Directory domain controllers managing domain groups, and using them to give different users different permissions on different systems in a network.

## Why?
I'm trying to learn more about systems administration and cybersecurity, like how to manage Windows and Linux desktops and servers in networks, how to analyze the security risks of computer networks and web applications.

So I use virtual machines (VMs) to create a more simplistic simulation of real world scenarios, like how a small organization with desktops and servers and network devices can create a network, and how the devices can be secured and monitored..
