## Intro
In this lab, I'm going to install the OWASP vulnerable web application Juice Shop on a [CentOS Linux](https://centos.org/) VM. I'll also use a CentOS workstation as a desktop computer for a systems administrator. I'll use that to manage the Juice Shop web application server. I'm going to configure the juiceshop VM to run like a server, so that the web application automatically runs when the server turns on.

I'll be using this VM in other cybersecurity labs.

## Why install this vulnerable web application?
I want to use this in later cybersecurity labs. There is [official documentation](https://pwning.owasp-juice.shop/companion-guide/latest/appendix/solutions.html) that explains how you can exploit the vulnerabilities. There's also many YouTube videos showing how to use penetration testing techniques and tools, like these [YouTube videos by Hacksplained](https://youtu.be/0YSNRz0NRt8?si=gwEorYl-xo6-CBe0).
