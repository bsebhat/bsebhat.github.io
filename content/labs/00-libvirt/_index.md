title: Lab 00 - libvirt
type: docs
next: 01-vm-infrastructure
---

In this initial lab, I'll install `libvirt`, `QEMU`, and `virt-manager` for my VM lab infrastructure. I'll also use a command line tool provided by `libvirt` called `virsh` to edit a virtual network.

I'll also create two virtual machines (VMs) and connect them to a virtual network, and have them communicate with eachother.
