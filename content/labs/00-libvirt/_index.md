title: Lab 00 - libvirt
type: docs
next: 01-vm-infrastructure
---

In this initial lab, I'll install libvirt, QEMU, and virt-manager for my VM lab infrastructure. I'll create simple virtual networks and VMs to test if it's running okay.

I'll also create VM templates for the CentOS, Windows 11, and Windows Server operating systems. I'll clone them in other VM labs when I need a desktop or server VM, and change the configurations.
