## Test
To test the `template-win11` clone. I'll clone it to a new VM called `win11-clone`. It gets a new IP address via the default network's DHCP service, and I'm able to ping it from my host machine.

## Conclusion
So, I was able to create a template Windows 11 desktop VM. I can use it in other labs, without having to install Windows 11 again.
