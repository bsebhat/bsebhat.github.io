I think I've settled on the rough drafts for the labs I've worked on. I went through several lab ideas, and tried them out.

The process was basically:
1. Come up with a tool I wanted to learn about.
2. Read documentation and blogs about the tool.
3. Come up with a lab goal (install X, integrate with Y, etc.)
4. Figure out how to setup a virtual machine (VM) environment to accomplish goal
5. Setup VMs and install software.
6. Try to accomplish goal.
7. Get stuck.
8. Look for solution on Reddit, Stack Overflow, etc.
9. Ask Chat GPT. Figure out how I screwed up. If it's huge, go back to step 5. Othewise, correct mistake.
11. Accomplish goal. Go back to step 5 and recreate steps while taking notes and screenshots.

I think I've figured out the steps to take for each lab, and I've included short, minimal notes and screenshots. Now, I need to go back and start writing out complete notes in complete sentences. If I find mistakes I missed, I'll see if they can be corrected or if the lab needs to be redone.

I think I want to add some more steps to the ends of the NextCloud and Wazuh labs. I just finished with setting them up, and I think I can push the goal further. Find a real life scenario to replicate. Something a systems administrator or security analyst would encounter.
