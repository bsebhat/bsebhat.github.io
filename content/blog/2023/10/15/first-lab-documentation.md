I finished my first lab documentation. It's for Lab 01: Template Arch Linux VM.

I'm going to be honest. I think it sucks. I have been working on VM labs for almost two months, and taking notes in Obsidian. So I'm used to a lab note-taking process of:
1. taking notes using markdown
2. regularly copying screenshots of the VM windows using a keyboard shortcut to the KDE application [Spectacle](https://github.com/KDE/spectacle)
3. easily pasting them in the Obsidian note markdown page

So, I tried that with this blog. I'm working on it in Visual Studio. I think I took way too many screenshots, and gave them filenames that are too long and complicated. Here's what the lab's directory looks like:
![files](../files.png)


It's way too much work. Slow things down. I think, for the next lab, I'll take fewer screenshots. And maybe use the Spectacle settings to automatically save screenshots to the lab directory.
![spectacle](../spectacle.png)

And I think I'll use code blocks rather than screenshots. Especially if it's just small changes to config files.
