I think I'll stop putting things like making VM templates of different operating systems in their own lab. I'l just make new blog posts about them, and have labs be things like installing a firewall or Splunk server.

I'll renumber the labs, with the first one being the one creating a VM Linux server running the vulnerable web app Juice Shop.
