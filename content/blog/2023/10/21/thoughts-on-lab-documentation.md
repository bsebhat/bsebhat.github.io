I'm still working on finishing my vm lab documentation. I've got most of the VM template labs, and the labs on creating a server to run a vulnerable web application and firewall server. I worked on the labs last month while I took rough notes, and I've been recreating the steps and adding them to this blog in a [lab section](../../../../../labs), adding screenshots and code snippets.

I'm trying to figure out how many details I should include in the labs documentation. An example of a blog describing a VM lab is [this blog post](https://benheater.com/virtualbox-lab-pfsense-firewall/) describing a pfSense Virtualbox lab. I think just about every step is included, with many screenshots. And if it's a screenshot of a terminal, it's cropped to show the relevant command.

I think I should document the steps, but I don't know how detailed I should make them. I didn't want to have too many screenshots, and tried to include more code blocks. I think I'll try to complete the labs, and if I learn more about documentation in the future, I'll come back and improve them. I don't want to get stuck trying to rewrite the same labs. Let's see how they read at the end, and figure out if they need more detail or less.

I think I should also include a table listing the labs on the main labs view, so that when someone clicks the "Labs" link, they can find a lab quickly. I should also include links to the prerequisite labs. For example, when the firewall lab requires the vulnerable web application lab, I should include a link to that, and a short explanation of why it should be completed before starting the next lab.
